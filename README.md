# Check-Number

 It is a Python function called check_number(num). I used the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 2. If num % 2 == 0, it prints "Even number", therefore it prints "Odd number." if it's not divisible by 2. Also, I tested it with different numbers, including the positives and negatives.
